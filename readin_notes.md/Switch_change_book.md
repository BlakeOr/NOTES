Title: switch: how to change things when change is hard

Intro:
study about people eating popcorn
apparently if you give people large containers of old stale popcorn they will eat ~50% more, even if both containers are too large to finish


### chapter 1
- i wonder if this has held up, i vaguely remeber hearing about some study that larger plates and dishes made you eat more was debunked, should look this up
- if this holds up and the dish thing doesn't, difference could be that behavior of eating is affected by amount of food and not container size. this would be hard to tell apart with the popcorn example since it is standard to always fill popcorn buckets up to the brim. 
  -looking this up a bit it seems like the studies hold up pretty well, not sure how to best search that though

- rolling alarm clock, runs from people in the morning
  - a sign that humans are not of one mind but are "scizophrenic" in some sense
- reminds me of my system of nightstand coffee
- the classic example here is drunk you making bad decisions, but i think for me horniness and sleepiness are some of the largest psychological distances i traverse

- analogy for emotion and logic:emotional brain is like an elephant being ridden by you (logic brain), you can't overpower it you have to incentivize it
- instant gratification vs planning. but emotion also allows you to be motivated and act. overplanning is the opposite of impulsive bad decisions.
  - must figure a way to work well with yourself
  - if you fight yourself you will just get exhausted

- self control as an exhaustible resource
- study of people brought in, told not to eat beforehand, into a room with radishes and chocolate cookie. 1/2 told to eat cookies, 1/2 told to eat radishes. then asked to do a difficult puzzle, those told to eat radishes gave up faster because they were mentally tired from resisting cookies..
- if self-control is like an exercise then it is locally a finite resource but over longer time it is a resource you can grow
- when people try to change automatic behaviors too much at once it will lead to exhaustion..


gloves story
- some guy at a company wanted to change things to save a bunch of money but knew it would hard to get people pn
