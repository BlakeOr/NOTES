steven isbell - has a code job, used to be a lead at a bootcamp, knows stuff about getting jobs

passion projects/side projects; good BUT - very rarely will you be the sole engineer on  a team.
work on group projects
if you can get actual active users, this is best

learning pace while working - varies a lot, startups tend to use new technologies, old companies use old techs

go for a startup of you thrive under fast paced environment
large companies are more consistent, can have better benefits
