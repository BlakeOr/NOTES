phrase often used online is that all the information you need is "at your fingertips" this is true in the literal sense (you use your fingers to interact with the puter) and half true in it's intended meaning (which i assume is that info is accessible)

the info online is canbe brought in front of you from anywhere, basically removing the factor of phsyical distance. i think it's kind of natural to think of thinsg literally farther from is as truly inaccessible but physical distance is not the best marker of how far you are from something, reallt it is just a proxy that is pretty well correlated with how hard it is to get something. the actual metrics here are more like time, resources, and attention that it takes to get something. 

i think about this every time i have to get a tool out of my dad's basement. the lowest floor of our house is a glorious places, it contains a concrete floored pantry at the base of the stairs, from there you can enter the "mancave" which rather than a place for drinking beer and watching sports is a room of gravel and dirt filled with paint and tools, finally you can go to the garage which is also full of tools. the number of tools i have at my disposal, mere dozens of feet from me, is amazing and i rarely use them because finding a single one will usually take at least 20 f*cking minutes of searching. it is certainly not unheard of to give up and buy something that we almost certainly have rather than finding it. 

the way i see it is that the longer it takes you to access a tool the "further" it is from you.

on the small scale tools in a workflow that require 1 or 2 additional clicks are very much like having your pen on the other side of your desk instead of next to your hand.

on the other end  there are probably plenty of free tools i could make use of that i will *never* find because they are lost in the clutter of the internet. 

i think the large annd small scale sides of this are different from real life in there own ways.

generally i think the problem of decluttering your digital space is easier to address than the physical. opening a program never causes you "move it from where you got it from" so to speak. and even if you never organize you bring most files up instantly  as long as you can remember a names and keywords.

the small scale problem seems to me much the opposite. if a program takes an extra click or doesn't readily display a bit of handy information it would take quite a bit of work to change it, if the access to change it is available at all. many of the tools on your digital desk are essentially bolted down.

often i find myself drawn to software projects that are the equivelant of prying off and rearranging my digital tools. the first program i ever wrote of my own was a chrome extension to display whether the browsers stopwatch function was running or not, because i kept forgetting and was tired of constantly clicking in and out of it. i recently made my first contribution to a strangers open ource project, all i did was take the instructions they had written on the github's readme and map them to a keyboard shortcut within the program. it wasn't much but it made the program much easier to work with. currently i am working on ways to make the note taking app roam research more usable for myself and hopefully others with my preferences. 

i wonder if there is a way that we could make apps more customizable from the ground up. i am not the visionary type who can say what that would look like. but i can think of some incremental changes that might be nice. a couple programs that come to mind are LMMS which opens every new subwindow/tool in a free floating workspace rather than having a set organization for it interface. i also i would love to see keyboard shortcuts and especially easy references for those shortcuts built into more programs (shout out to figma which is the first app i encountered like this).

 of course i acknowledge that these examples are for more "power user" type scenarios. on the lighter end i don't have any clever recommenations but i always try to think about reducing the digital distance between a user and what they want to access. this can often be thought of as "removing clicks" and i often do, although sometimes adding a clicks to replace something like a huge page which would require a lot of scrolling could be an upgrade.

 to take a moment to gripe, i think a prime example is the group project i worked on at bootcamp. we were making a navigation app for large vehicles. when our time was up there were still a lot of potential features to be added so we passed it onto another group. checking in on the app a few weeks later, the UI was noticeably nicer. but after trying to use it i was dismayed, the
